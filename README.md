Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up an OS X laptop for web development.
This is forked from Thoughtbot's Laptop script

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conspire-org/laptop/master/mac
less mac
bash mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`. Read through it to see if
you can debug the issue yourself. If not, copy the lines where the script
failed into a [new GitHub
Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us. Or, attach the
whole log file as an attachment.

What it sets up
---------------

* [Bundler] for managing Ruby libraries
* [Foreman] for serving Rails apps locally
* [Heroku Config] for local `ENV` variables
* [Heroku Toolbelt] for interacting with the Heroku API
* [Homebrew] for managing operating system libraries
* [ImageMagick] for cropping and resizing images
* [Node.js] and [NPM], for running apps and installing JavaScript packages
* [NVM] for managing versions of Node.js
* [Postgres] for storing relational data
* [Qt] for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* [RVM] for managing versions of Ruby
* [Redis] for storing key-value data
* [Ruby] stable for writing general-purpose code
* [Zsh] as your shell

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Laptop can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It will upgrade
already installed packages and install and activate a new version of ruby (if
one is available).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask

brew cask install dropbox
brew cask install google-chrome
brew cask install rdio
```

You should write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than
once. See the `mac` script for examples.
